# Food Price Tracker

## Purpose

Access to reliable food pricing information is crucial for informed decision-making in policymaking and business strategy.
However, existing platforms lack comprehensive global trends with regional detail, posing challenges for non-technical users.
The project aims to provide an intuitive, interactive data visualization platform to empower stakeholders for food price insights and enhance cross-sector collaboration to address worldwide food-related challenges.
